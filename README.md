This is a simple password generator CLI tool I made out of curiosity over how Node.js helps in creating CLI tools.

In order to use this on your local system:

1. Install package :
2.                   npm install -g password-gen-custom

3. Run command 
4.                password-generator generate -l <length> -u -n -s

5. Options
- -l <length>: Specify the length of your password (default is 12 characters).
- -u: Include uppercase letters in your password.
- -n: Include numbers in your password.
- -s: Include special characters in your password.
