This is a simple password generator CLI tool I made out of curiosity over how Node.js helps in creating CLI tools.

In order to use this on your local system:

1. Install package : ```bash npm install -g password-gen-custom

2. Run command ```bash password-generator geneerate -l (specify length) -u -n -s

3. The -l flag is to specify the length of your password, set to default value 12.
   The -u flag is to include upper case characters in your password.
   -n flag is to include intergers in your password.
   -s flag is to include special characters in your passwords.
